# MANHATTAN_DIST
The "Farthest Pair Distance Calculator" is a Java program designed to find the farthest pair of points from a list of input coordinates based on the Manhattan distance metric. The goal is to efficiently iterate through the pairs to find the farthest pair ensuring optimal performance.

This is how you are to input your points </br>
    Enter the number of points: </br>
    4 </br>
    Enter the coordinates of each point: </br>
    1 1 </br>
    1 3 </br>
    4 2 </br>
    5 6 </br>
The program will print out the two points which are the farthest from each other </br>
    Farthest pair of points:</br>
    1 1 </br>
    5 6 </br>
